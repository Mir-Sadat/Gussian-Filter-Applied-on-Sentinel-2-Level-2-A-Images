# Gussian-Filter-Applied-on-Sentinel-2-Level-2-A-Images

The Gaussian filter is a widely used smoothing technique that reduces noise and detail in images by applying a Gaussian function to calculate the weights of neighboring pixels. This filter gives more importance to pixels near the center of the kernel and less to those further away, creating a soft blurring effect. It is particularly effective for removing high-frequency noise while preserving general image structure. When applied to multiband TIFF images, each band is processed individually, allowing the filter to smooth each spectral layer independently. Gaussian filtering is commonly used as a preprocessing step in image analysis tasks like object detection, segmentation, and classification, especially when minor noise needs to be reduced without significantly distorting the overall image content.
